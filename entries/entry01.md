# Entry 1
##### 11/05/2020

As of the time this blog entry is being written, we are on the the blog setup and deciding/tinkering with our tools part of the engineering design process. So far my decided tool for this project is Firebase. My reason for choosing this tool is because I want to make an app that can record what I do on during my daily routine. I still haven't decdied what I wanted to record yet but I know its most likely going to be a quantitative data sort.
